    <<Menus>>
To navigate menus, use the up and down arrows, and Enter to select an option.
   <<Explore Overworld>>
  To explore the current world you are on, select Explore in the Console menu after selecting your desired location under
Travel. To move, use the arrow keys. To repair your ship and gain back Ship and Shield HP, press 2nd. Note that you have to
wait some time before your ship is repaired and you can move again, so be sure to stay away from the enemy onscreen! To 
pause, press MODE, and to return to the Console menu, maneuver yourself using the arrow keys to 1,1 in the top right corner,
marked by a "Q", or space station.
    There is a random chance while wandering around in space that your ship's sensors will detect a wreckage floating around.
to examine and take it, maneuver your ship on top of it.
    <<Battles>>
  To engage in a battle, the enemy ship must maneuver itself until it's on top of your ship. Then, the battle will start. To
attempt to flee, press CLEAR. The chance to flee with F rank thrusters is approximately 33%. As you upgrade your thrusters,
the chance of fleeing increases. If you fail to flee, the enemy attacks you.
To target an area of the enemy ship to attack, press 2nd. To select the area to attack, navigate with the left and right
arrow keys and confirm with 2nd. Attacking the opponent's weapons gives a 50% chance of them not attacking that turn.
Attacking the hull yields normal damage, and attacking the bridge gives a 50% chance of doing 10 more damage, or 10 less if
you get the other 50%.
  The enemy can't damage your ship until your shields are down. If your shields are down, the enemy will
do half damage to your ship in relation to the amount of damage it has left from attacking the shields. If your shields are
at 0 and an enemy would do 20 damage to shields, they do 10 damage to your ship. If your shields are at 10 and they would do
20 damage to your shields, they do 5 damage to your ship.
    <<Travelling in Space>>
To travel to another planet, select Travel in the Console menu. As you upgrade your thrusters, you will be able to access
more planets with enemies that are more difficult to defeat. Planets you can not yet visit have their names in gray.
   <<Upgrading your Ship>>
Each part of your ship (weapons, thrusters and shields) can all be upgraded a maximum of 7 times from their original level.
Upgrading parts of your ship can also have certain side effects other than those in battle, such as being able to access more
planets. In battle, upgrading your ship can slightly alter the appearance of it, such as altering the color or appearance of
those parts.
